# For some reason, by default hyprland uses both dedicated & integrated card
# which can lead to power management problems, because dedicated gpu won't turn off *

# *Figured it out. discrete gpu wont turn off because it is still needed for hdmi port
# Also, being used with this variable, it actually consumes same power as if it would not be specified
